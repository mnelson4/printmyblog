## Note to Developers on Backward Compatibility

There is **NO GUARANTEE** of backward compatibility unless you have contacted us to inform us of your integration (eg 
created an issue in GitHub discussing what your integration/customization does and what it depends on.) 

Eg the following can change anytime: 
* PHP class names, function names, constants, 
* HTML tags, classes, ids
* CSS styles
* Javascript clases, functions, etc

This allows us to remove code debt (ie, change old code as the need arises) and accelerate development. Thank you for understanding
and communicating your integrations' needs ahead of time.
