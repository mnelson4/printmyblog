Make printing your blog easy and impressive. For you & your visitors. One post or thousands.

== Description ==

**Offline publishing for you, site visitors, and the world outside WordPress.**

Print My Blog makes WordPress content useful outside of your website, like in print, PDFs, and other formats. It has 3 main features:

1. Quick Print: print thousands of posts in a few clicks
2. Print Buttons: let site visitors print individual posts
3. Pro Print: make professional-quality books and documents

Each of which takes your WordPress content and optimizes it for print, PDF, and eBook by:

* removing ink guzzlers like site logo, sidebars, and footer
* avoiding page breaks inside images, between images and captions, and even right after headers
* allowing you to use other plugins in your printed output

Read more about each...

= Quick Print =

Quick Print lets you easily print your entire blog to paper, PDF, or eBook.

* **Print your blog** to read offline.
* **Create a paper backup** (book or printout) to read when your blog is taken offline.
* **Create a PDF, ePub, or MOBI file** as a human-readable, portable backup. Send it to friends, store it in the cloud or a hard drive, or even archive it with a historical organization.
* **Copy your entire Blog** for quick pasting into another program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs

**Quick Print Features**

* Loads all your blog‚Äôs posts into a single web page so you can print them from your web browser (to paper, PDF, ePub, or anything your web browser supports) or copy-and-paste them into another program (although the other program likely won‚Äôt format it as nicely)
* supports printing thousands of blog posts in one click (the record is over 3000 posts)
* prints posts and pages
* uses your theme‚Äôs and plugins‚Äô styles (so Gutenberg and page builders are supported)
* print your entire blog, or filter by author, date, status (e.g. draft, pending, private, password-protected, trashed, etc.), category, and tags
* optionally prints comments
* optionally places each post on a new page
* resizes text
* resizes images or removes them altogether
* replaces embedded videos with a link, full video title, screenshot and QRCode
* optionally removes hyperlinks
* optionally includes post excerpts
* orders posts by date, and pages by the "order" attribute
* place the ‚ÄúPrint My Blog‚Äù Gutenberg block on a page and allow site visitors to print your blog too
* no watermark in print-out, and attribution optional,
* [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) compliant (no data is collected about you or your visitors)
* free, open-source software, so you can use it for whatever you like without fear of changing terms of use,
customize it to fit your needs (although we'd be curious to hear what you've done with it), and even redistribute it. There is no lengthy legal document describing how you're giving up your rights by using this software!

= Print Buttons =
You can also automatically add print buttons to help your visitors print your blog.

* **Share** your content with friends offline
* **Save** it for reading later
* **Improve long reads** by converting a portion of your blog to eBook or PDF

* customize print button text (e.g. "Print", "Imprimir", or just a print emoji like üñ®)
* buttons use theme's design
* make more seamless integration with your design or content using the shortcode `[pmb_print_page_url]` to just get the URL of the print page ([see this FAQ for more details](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-my-blog/#how%20do%20i%20show%20the%20print%20buttons%20on%20posts%20or%20pages%3F))

= Plugin Compatibility Highlights =

PMB strives to be compatible with all plugins. But here are some that are especially noteworthy:

* [BasePress](https://printmy.blog/2021/06/14/making-a-user-manual-for-web-pdf-print-with-wordpress/) for creating a user manual on both the web and print
* [WP Quick LaTeX](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/) for mathematical formulas
* [Translate WordPress with GTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gtranslate/) for quick and automatic translating of projects
* [WPML](https://wpml.org) for more advanced translating of projects, and adding print buttons in different languages. [Read Translating Projects with WPML Plugin](https://printmy.blog/user-guide/design-layout/translating-projects-with-wpml-plugin/)
* [TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/) makes tables look good in print too, even when they span multiple pages

> ‚ö†Ô∏èIncompability: Some users have reported incompability issues with the Divi theme. If you are using this theme, please use Print My Blog with caution and always back up your database before use. 

If you are delighted how PMB worked with another plugin, or had trouble, please let us know!

= Our Mission =
1. Preserve your blog for decades to come in a low-tech format.
2. Make WordPress an alternative to Microsoft Word and Google Docs for publishing documents.

= Alternatives to Print My Blog =

If this doesn't meet your needs, there are good paid and free alternatives.

**Alternatives to Quick Print**
[printmy.blog](https://printmy.blog/now) we run a hosted version of this same plugin, so you can print your blog without even installing this. Especially useful for WordPress**.com** users, or those who can't install the plugin on their site. (Its free like Quick Print, but won't use your blog's styles.)
[Anthologize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/) is another great plugin for customizing your blog's content before exporting to an e-book format. Also free.
[Blog To HTML](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-to-html/) is actually very similar to Print My Blog. It allows you to export your blog to HTML for eBook creation.
[blogbooker](https://blogbooker.com/) prints a book, or creates a PDF, from your blog using their pre-made styles. (Paid service.)
[blog2print](https://www.blog2print.com/) ditto, but temporarily requests your username and password. (Paid service.)

**Alternatives for adding print buttons**
[Print, PDF, Email by PrintFriendly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/printfriendly/) lets visitors easily print to paper, PDF, or email themselves a copy. Easy setup and very customizable. Doesn‚Äôt use theme‚Äôs styles. The free version is not GDPR-compliant and inserts advertisements.
[WP Print Friendly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-print-friendly/) automatically adds a link to print the current post, page, or custom post type. Can convert links to endnotes. Doesn‚Äôt use theme‚Äôs styles.
[WP-Print](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-print/) printouts quite customizable. Requires editing theme files. Does not use theme‚Äôs styles.
[Print-o-Matic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-o-matic/) add print buttons with a shortcode. Customizable and can work with theme‚Äôs and plugin‚Äôs styles.
[PDF Generator for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pdf-generator-for-wp/) Create & Customize PDF for Post, Pages and WooCommerce Products

**Alternatives to Pro Print**
[MPL - Publisher](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mpl-publisher/) is another free eBook creator / PDF converter plugin you can use to self-publish a book. To be honest probably the best alternative right now. There's both free and paid versions.
[PressBooks](https://pressbooks.com/) is a good paid, hosted alternative. Begin creating or import content for free, and can pay to export to PDF and other formats.
[Designrr](https://designrr.io/) is great for creating short documents, but is a fully paid option.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Pro Print for Free? =
Yes, you can use PMB's Pro Print for free (it's included in this plugin) to create projects, and can print or make PDFs with them using your web browser. Your web browser will not, however, support all the features that Pro Print is capable of (e.g. adding page references, footnotes, and fully controlling page margins).

ePub eBooks with Pro Print require payment.

So, creating PDFs and printing with PMB Pro Print is free, but it's best when used with our [Pro PDF Service](https://printmy.blog/pricing/) which is paid.

= I have a question about Pro Print =
You're in luck, we have an [entire user guide](https://printmy.blog/user-guide/) that walks you through the first project, then onto customizations, and even through making your own custom designs in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (with a bit of PHP). These FAQs are mostly about Quick Print and Print Buttons.

= How do I create a PDF using Quick Print? =

Quick Print just puts the content onto a single web page so your browser can print it or create a PDF from it. Because your browser is what creates the PDF, it depends on the browser. Check out the instructions that apply to you:

Google Chrome

https://youtu.be/ngId20fP5I8

Mozilla Firefox

https://youtu.be/ekwg2a1FPV0

Note: Images may be missing from very large PDFs. See the FAQ "My PDFs are missing images" below for help.

If you use Pro Print, you can download the PDF using our [Pro Print Service](https://printmy.blog/pricing/).

= How do I remove the headers and footers from printouts? =
*One option is to upgrade for the [Pro Print Service](https://printmy.blog/pricing/), which adds more professional-looking content to the margins (e.g. page numbers, running headers, and logos).*

You probably don't want the site's title, date, and URL appearing in printouts. Here is how to remove it for various browsers:

Google Chrome (for paper and PDF)

https://youtu.be/2Kvun-nhCWk

Mozilla Firefox (paper)

https://youtu.be/vp-wGdS8ugE

Mozilla Firefox (PDF)

https://youtu.be/sU02oSPWj34

= How do I create an eBook using Print My Blog? =
Creating ePub eBooks requires payment, or you can create ePub eBooks using Quick Print and [dotEPUB browser extension](https:dotepub.com)

https://youtu.be/M5ZZN3KsqOA

Note: if your printout has many images, dotEpub warns you it will replace them with links.

Once the eBook has been generated, you can read it from your computer (here's instructions on how to [read ePubs](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-EPUB-Files) and [MOBI files](https://www.howtogeek.com/360419/what-is-a-mobi-file/)), or a phone or tablet.

= Some images aren't appearing =

Print My Blog can work too fast for some webservers, meaning the webservers refuse to load all the content, most noticeably some images.
In order to fix this, you need to tell Print My Blog to slow down. On the configuration page, show options, then scroll
down to show Troubleshooting options, and increase "Post Rendering Wait-Time" (e.g. to 2000 milliseconds, or whatever
value you need to in order to get all the images to load).

= My PDFs are missing images =
*This is usually a problem with browsers, which our [Pro PDF Service](https://printmy.blog/pricing/) hasn't experienced. So you may want to try Pro Print with the Pro PDF Service.*

If your print-page has hundreds of images, browsers may generate PDFs that are missing images at the end.
To fix this, just retry "Generate the PDF". Each time the browser will fetch more images. Continue re-generating the PDF until the images at the end are included.

= The Print Page says "There seems to be an error initializing...", or is stuck on "Loading Content", or I can't filter by categories or terms from the print setup page=
*This isn't a problem for Pro Print (even when printing using your browser for free.) If you'd rather use Quick Print, keep reading...*

A plugin has probably disabled the WP REST API, which Print My Blog uses for loading data.

This is often done by a security plugin.

* Don't use "Disable REST API" plugins
* "All in One WP Security" has a setting called "Disallow Unuahtorized REST API requests". Disable it.
* Wordfence has a setting on their "All Options" page, under "Brute Force Proection", called "Prevent discovery of usernames through ‚Äò/?author=N‚Äô scans, the oEmbed API, and the WordPress REST API". [Disable it.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3-2BjNSWQBUi1uPxq_l2gCj4xXZ44MD/view)
* iThemes security has a setting under "WordPress Tweaks" called "REST API". [Switch it to "Default Access"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jvujNmQuMMUDWls1LNndHM8pmpP53Ktt/view) if you want to let site visitors print your blog.

If none of the above help identify the issue, please use Print My Blog plugin's Help page or the [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/print-my-blog/) to report the problem.
Along with that, it can also be helpful to follow the steps in the following video in order to provide more information about the error.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNK39YuuhMM

= How do I remove post content from the printout? =

There may be text, images, and other stuff that looks great when viewed from a screen, but doesn't make sense to have in the printout. E.g. related posts, share buttons, etc.
To remove them from printouts, [add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-screen-only".
Alternatively, you can use the shortcodes `[pmb_web_only_text]...text, text, text...[/pmb_web_only_text]` and `[pmb_web_only_blocks]...paragraphs, images, other blocks...[/pmb_web_only_blocks]`.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxNBkGafH_A

If you're handy at writing CSS, add some additional CSS to your theme that uses the "pmb-print-page" class which is added to the `body` tag of the print page.

For example, if you want to hide all divs with CSS class "my-video" in printouts, but not on the regular website, add the following CSS to your theme:

`
.pmb-print-page div.my-video{
    display:none;
}
`

Also, if it's content automatically added by a plugin or theme, please let us know in the support forum, and we can hide that content in the next release of Print My Blog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMBxCp7AVPE&feature=youtu.be

= How do I make post content only appear in the printout? =
Use the shortcodes `[pmb_print_only_text]...text, text, text...[/pmb_print_only_text]` and `[pmb_print_only_blocks]...paragraphs, images, other blocks...[/pmb_print_only_blocks]`.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxNBkGafH_A

[Alternatively, add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-print-only". See the above question for more details.

= How do I show or hide background colors in the printout? =
* In Pro Print, the background colors are dictated by your project's design, which might be easily customizable. Go to your project's "Customize Design" step and see what settings are available. You can also switch to a different design on the "Choose Design" step, or add some custom CSS to your design (`body{background-color:black;}`).*

If you're using Quick Print, the background colors are controlled by your WordPress theme and the browser.

Your theme may use different styles when printed, including setting the background to white in order to conserve ink.

But if not, your browser can also remove background colors.

* For Google Chrome: when printing, [click on "More Options", then uncheck "Background graphics"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5c9XJbBGhSeRlmGxqZBRv5n4CTWZyag/view?usp=sharing)

* For Firefox: when viewing the print preview, [click "Page Setup" then uncheck "Print Background (colors & images)".](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VoVCC6ehqd8vZyO89PQq5hZbQ4u94vBK)

* For Firefox Extension "Print to PDF": [click on "Add-ons", then click "Print to PDF", then "Options", and uncheck "Whether the background colors should be shown"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WjCS84LLOL6v0ccjASjJ3c_vaUmgIfTO)

= How do I force a page break before something? (So it's always at the top of a page) =
[Add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-page-break" onto the the element/block you want to be at the top of the page.

= How do I avoid a pagebreak inside something? =
[Add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-no-break" onto the element/block. The browser will avoid a pagebreak in that element if possible.
If browsers ignore that, you force the pagebreak to happen just before an element by adding the CSS class "pmb-page-break".

= How do I print a draft? =
The easiest way to print a draft post is to enable the front-end print buttons, then view the preview of the post, and click the print button you want.

https://youtu.be/LemXhydDEvg

= How do I show the print buttons on posts or pages? =
**Using Print My Blog Settings and Custom Fields**
You can add print buttons to all posts and/or pages from the WordPress admin dashboard, under "Print My Blog", click "Settings", then, next to "Show print buttons on:" select the posts and/or pages.
If you don't want to show them on certain posts or pages, add the custom field named "pmb_buttons" to them with the value "hide".
Alternatively, if you only want to show the button on specific posts or pages, add the custom field "pmb_buttons" to those posts or pages with the value "show".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehep6GO5J6c

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWD8kDrhWMs

**Using a Shortcode in the Post Body**
You can add print buttons directly into your posts and pages by using the shortcode `[pmb_print_buttons]`. You can also supply it with the ID of a different post or page like so: `[pmb_print_buttons ID=123]`.
You can alternatively use the shortcode `[pmb_print_page_url]` to just get the URL of the print page for more advanced integrations. You can supply it with the ID of a different post, and the `format` (defaults to "print", but also accepts "pdf" or "ebook"), and whether to `add_protocol` (i.e. by default, the URL begins with "http://" or "https://", but setting this to `0` will prevent that, in case it was already added), like so: `[pmb_print_page_url format=pdf add_protocol=0]` will produce the URL of the print page for a PDF but not add the "https://" onto the start of the URL.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxNBkGafH_A

**In a Widget (e.g. sidebar or footer) using a Shortcode**
Alternatively, you can add the print buttons to a widget. In the WordPress admin dashboard, under the "Appearance" menu item, click "Widgets". Add a shortcode widget and add `[pmb_print_buttons]` like mentioned previously. The print buttons will only appear on single posts (eg not on an archive page).

https://youtu.be/tLI1AAnxi-c

**Editing Your Theme's Template Files**
If you'd like to add the print buttons somewhere in your theme's template files, add the following PHP code anywhere inside the loop:

`
<?php echo do_shortcode('[pmb_print_buttons]'); ?>
`
or
`
<a href="<?php echo esc_url(do_shortcode('[pmb_print_page_url]')); ?>">View Print-Ready Version of Page</a>
`

= How do I change the color of the print buttons? =
The print button's color is determined by your theme. But if you can't change the button colors using your theme's settings, you can change it with some custom CSS.
E.g. this here's how to change the button's text color to black and background color to white:

**For Block-Based Themes**
1. Go to wp-admin on your website
2. On the left, under "Appreance", click "Editor"
3. On the left, click "Styles"
4. Click the pencil icon that appears ("Edit Styles")
5. On the top-right, beside "Styles", click the three dots
6. Select "Additional CSS"
7. Add the following code:

**For Legacy Themes:**
1. Go to wp-admin on your website
2. On the left, under "Appearance", click "Customize"
3. On the left, under Additional CSS" add the the following code:

`
div.pmb-print-this-page a{
    color:black;
    background-color:white;
}
`

= How do I customize the printouts made with the Print Buttons? =
From the Print My Blog Settings page, click "Customize Buttons". From here you can customize:
* whether print buttons appear by default above or below the post content
* which print buttons appear (print, PDF, and eBook)
* the text used on each button (translate them, use an emoji, etc.)

Under each format, you can also click "Show Options". These options affect the printout produced by the button. These
options are the same as when printing out multiple posts simultaneously: you can remove the printout metadata, the post's featured image, etc.

https://youtu.be/uPQ3vqm7A2g

= How can I help translate Print My Blog? =
Here's a video showing how to use Poedit to submit a translation of Print My Blog

https://youtu.be/HnbCKywA_xo
