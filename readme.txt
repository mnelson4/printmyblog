= Example Use-Cases =

**Time to prune your website’s content?** You can print it, annotate and sort through a physical stack of paper.

**Disconnecting offline for a bit?** Print your blog to paper, or even an ePub file to read from your Kindle or phone.

**Shutting down your site?** In addition to making a regular backup (which can only be read by recreating your entire site, which may be difficult as the software it requires gets more dated), make a PDF backup of it.

**Wonder what will happen to your blog’s stories after your gone?** Your blog might not be online forever, but you can use Print My Blog to distribute readable copies of it to those you care about.

= Our Mission =

Besides just converting your blog to a different format, the plugin’s mission is to preserve your blog for decades to come in a low-tech format.
Your website might not be around forever, nor might WordPress. But by printing it, there’s hope your blog’s ideas and stories can live on.

= Alternatives to Print My Blog =

If this doesn't meet your needs, there are good paid and free alternatives.

[Dead Easy Family History](https://deadeasyfamilyhistory.org/print-my-blog) runs a hosted version of this same plugin, so you can print your blog without even installing this. Especially useful for WordPress**.com** users, or those who can't install the plugin on their site.
(Its free, but won't use your blog's styles).
[Anthologize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/) is another great plugin for customizing your blog's content before exporting to an e-book format. Also free.
[bloxp](http://www.bloxp.com/) converts your blog into an e-book with any type of blog (not just WordPress). Fewer, but different, options. Supported by donations.
[blogbooker](https://blogbooker.com/) prints a book, or creates a PDF, from your blog using their pre-made styles. Paid service.
[blog2print](https://www.blog2print.com/) ditto, but temporarily requests your username and password. Paid service.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Some images aren't appearing =

Print My Blog can work too fast for some webservers, meaning the webservers refuse to load all the content, most noticeably some images.
In order to fix this, you need to tell Print My Blog to slow down. On the configuration page, show options, then scroll
down to show Troubleshooting options, and increase "Post Rendering Wait-Time" (eg to 2000 milliseconds, or whatever
value you need to in order to get all the images to load).
