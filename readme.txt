Print your entire blog in one click!

== Description ==

Print your entire blog in one click!
Don't print your blog posts manually one-by-one. Don't print unnecessary stuff like your sidebar widgets or footer.
Plugin alternative to [blog2print](https://www.blog2print.com), except you can print with your own printer or even your browser's print-to-pdf feature.

No upsells, no premium version. Entirely supported by donations.

= Why would I want to print my entire blog? =
Glad you asked:

* backup your memories in a format that will still be readable in 100 years: paper!
* share it offline
* create a book from your blog (although [Anthologize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/) might be a better option for that)

= How does it work? =

It works with hundreds of blog posts, with Gutenberg and page builder posts.
Only your posts’ content is printed, not your logo, site title, sidebar widgets, footer, etc. Just the stuff you care to read.

= But You’re Destroying Trees! =
Yes it can be a lot of paper. But your latest package delivery used up about the same amount of tree. Besides, you can recycle the pages if you’re done. Lastly, you don’t need to actually print to paper. Google Chrome and other browsers allow you to instead print to PDF.

== What's the Big Deal? ==

The mission is: preserve our blogs to a low-tech format.

Your website might not be around forever, nor might WordPress. But by printing it, there’s hope your blog’s ideas and stories can live on.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Go to Tools->Print To Blog
1. Press "Prepare Print Page"
1. When you see "Print Now" appear, click it.

== Troubleshooting ==
* the WP API (or REST API) needs to not be deactivated
* caching plugins should probably be deactivated before use
