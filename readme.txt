Create a paper/PDF copy of your entire blog in one click!

== Description ==

Print your  blog in 1 click! Use your own web browser to create a paper, PDF, or even e-book copy.
A paper copy may  be readable in 100 years- long after your website is taken down and your digital backups are corrupted.
"Print My Blog" makes this really easy: no need to print your blog posts one-by-one, or print unnecessary stuff like your sidebar widgets or footer.
One click printing of your entire blog's contents in a format optimized for print.
Plugin alternative to [blog2print](https://www.blog2print.com) and [blogbooker](https://blogbooker.com/), except you can print with your own printer or even your browser's print-to-pdf feature.

No upsells, no premium version.

= Why would I want to print my entire blog? =

Glad you asked:

* backup your memories in a format that has no technological dependencies: paper! (Or other portable formats like PDF or ePub.)
* easily share an entire blog offline
* create a book from your blog (although [Anthologize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/) might be a better option for that)
* when shutting down a blog, convert its content to an easy-to-read format

It works with thousands of blog posts (or pages), with Gutenberg, and page builders.
Only your posts’ content is printed, not your logo, site title, sidebar widgets, footer, etc. Just the stuff you care to read.

There is also a Print My Blog block which you can place on a page which will allow your site visitors to print the entire blog too.\

Features:

* loads all your blog's posts into a single page so you can print them from your web browser
* supports printing thousands of blog posts in one click (the record is over 3000 posts)
* print posts and pages
* does not print ink-guzzlers like site logo, sidebar widgets, or footer
* uses your theme's and plugins' styles (so Gutenberg and page builders are supported)
* optionally print comments
* optionally place each post on a new page
* resize text
* resize images or remove them altogether
* no watermark in print-out (it does say you used this plugin, but that can be removed)
* remove hyperlinks
* optionally include post's excerpt
* place the "Print My Blog" Gutenberg block on a page and allow site visitors to print your blog

Please see the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/mnelson4/printmyblog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for other features requested.

= How Does It Work? =

After activating the plugin and clicking "Prepare Print Page"
1. your blog's posts are fetched in a way that thousands can be put on the page at once
(using the WP REST API)
2. a few instructions are given to the browser on how to print the page nicely (using CSS)
3. your web browser takes care of printing.

It turns out web browsers are pretty good at printing to paper. They're also good at saving the web page to a PDF file (eg Google Chrome)
 and even creating e-books (they may an add-on for this.)

= But You’re Destroying Trees! =
Yes it can be a lot of paper. But

* it might not be that much compared to how much paper you've used on books, cereal boxes, and package deliveries (and it's recyclable anyway)
* there are paper-saving options, like using small text, multiple columns, and smaller images (or no images at all)
* lastly, you don’t need to actually print to paper. Google Chrome and other browsers allow you to instead print to PDF.

== What's the Big Deal? ==

The mission is: preserve your blog for decades to come in a low-tech format.

Your website might not be around forever, nor might WordPress. But by printing it, there’s hope your blog’s ideas and stories can live on.
