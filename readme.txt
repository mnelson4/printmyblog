= Features =

* supports printing thousands of blog posts in one click (the record is over 3000 posts)
* prints posts and pages
* does not print ink-guzzlers like site logo, sidebar widgets, or footer
* avoids page breaks inside images, between images and captions, and even right after headers; generally makes the content print-ready

* optionally include private and password-protected posts

* no watermark in print-out, and attribution optional,
* [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) compliant (no data is collected about your visitors)
* no upsells, advertising, or data collection (we can't even know which sites use this software)
* free, open-source software, so you can use it for whatever you like without fear of changing terms of use,
customize it to fit your needs (although we'd curious to hear what you've done with it), and even redistribute it. There is no lengthy legal document describing how you're giving up your rights by using this software!

= Example Use-Cases =

**Time to prune your website’s content?** You can print it, annotate and sort through a physical stack of paper.

**Disconnecting offline for a bit?** Print your blog to paper, or even an ePub file to read from your Kindle or phone.

**Shutting down your site?** In addition to making a regular backup (which can only be read by recreating your entire site, which may be difficult as the software it requires gets more dated), make a PDF backup of it.

**Wonder what will happen to your blog’s stories after your gone?** Your blog might not be online forever, but you can use Print My Blog to distribute readable copies of it to those you care about.

= Our Mission =

Besides just converting your blog to a different format, the plugin’s mission is to preserve your blog for decades to come in a low-tech format.
Your website might not be around forever, nor might WordPress. But by printing it, there’s hope your blog’s ideas and stories can live on.

= Alternatives to Print My Blog =

If this doesn't meet your needs, there are good paid and free alternatives.

**Alternatives for printing your entire blog**

[Dead Easy Family History](https://deadeasyfamilyhistory.org/print-my-blog) runs a hosted version of this same plugin, so you can print your blog without even installing this. Especially useful for WordPress**.com** users, or those who can't install the plugin on their site.
(Its free, but won't use your blog's styles).
[Anthologize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/) is another great plugin for customizing your blog's content before exporting to an e-book format. Also free.
[bloxp](http://www.bloxp.com/) converts your blog into an e-book with any type of blog (not just WordPress). Fewer, but different, options. Supported by donations.
[MPL - Publisher](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mpl-publisher/) is another free eBook creator / PDF converter plugin you can use to self-publish a book. Good features but not recently updated.
[PressBooks](https://pressbooks.com/) is a good eBook maker. Begin creating or import content for free, and can pay to export to PDF and other formats.
[Blog To HTML](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-to-html/) is actually very similar to Print My Blog. It allows you to export your blog to HTML for eBook creation.
[blogbooker](https://blogbooker.com/) prints a book, or creates a PDF, from your blog using their pre-made styles. Paid service.
[blog2print](https://www.blog2print.com/) ditto, but temporarily requests your username and password. Paid service.

**Alternatives for adding print buttons**
[Print, PDF, Email by PrintFriendly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/printfriendly/) lets visitors easily print to paper, PDF, or email themselves a copy. Easy setup and very customizable. Doesn’t use theme’s styles. The free version is not GDPR-compliant and inserts advertisements.
[WP Print Friendly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-print-friendly/) automatically adds a link to print the current post, page, or custom post type. Can convert links to endnotes. Doesn’t use theme’s styles.
[WP-Print](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-print/) printouts quite customizable. Requires editing theme files. Does not use theme’s styles.
[Print-o-Matic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-o-matic/) add print buttons with a shortcode. Customizable and can work with theme’s and plugin’s styles.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a PDF using Print My Blog? =
This plugin just puts the content onto a single web page so your browser can print it or create a PDF from it. Because your browser is what creates the PDF, it depends on the browser. Check out the instructions that apply to you:

Google Chrome

https://youtu.be/ngId20fP5I8

Mozilla Firefox

https://youtu.be/ekwg2a1FPV0

Note: images may be missing from very large PDFs. See the FAQ "My PDFs are missing images" below for help.

= How do I create an eBook using Print My Blog? =
This plugin puts your blog's content onto a single web page, and you can then use the [dotEPUB browser extension](https:dotepub.com) to turn it into an eBook.

https://youtu.be/M5ZZN3KsqOA

Note: if your printout has many images, dotEpub warns you it will replace them with links.

Once the eBook has been generated, you can read it from your computer (here's instructions on how to [read ePubs](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-EPUB-Files) and [MOBI files](https://www.howtogeek.com/360419/what-is-a-mobi-file/)), or a phone or tablet.

= Some images aren't appearing =

Print My Blog can work too fast for some webservers, meaning the webservers refuse to load all the content, most noticeably some images.
In order to fix this, you need to tell Print My Blog to slow down. On the configuration page, show options, then scroll
down to show Troubleshooting options, and increase "Post Rendering Wait-Time" (eg to 2000 milliseconds, or whatever
value you need to in order to get all the images to load).

= My PDFs are missing images =
If your print-page has hundreds of images, browsers may generate PDFs that are missing images at the end.
To fix this, just retry generate the PDF. Each time the browser will fetch more images. Continue re-generating the PDF until the images at the end are included.

= The Print Page says "There seems to be an error initializing...", or is stuck on "Loading Content", or I can't filter by categories or terms from the print setup page=

You may have disabled the WP REST API. (Eg by using "All in One WP Security" plugin's "Disallow Unauthorized REST API Requests" or "Disable REST API" plugin). Print My Blog uses the WP REST API to load your posts into the print-page, so please ensure the WP REST API is enabled.

= How do I remove post content from the printout? =

There may be text, images, and other stuff that looks great when viewed from a screen, but doesn't make sense to have in the printout. Eg, related posts, share buttons, etc.
To remove them from printouts, [add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-screen-only".

Also, if it's content automatically added by a plugin or theme, please let us know in the support forum, and we can hide that content in the next release of Print My Blog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMBxCp7AVPE&feature=youtu.be

= How do I make post content only appear in the printout? =

[Add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-print-only". See the above question for more details.

= How do I show or hide background colors in the printout? =

Your theme may use different styles when printed, including setting the background to white in order to conserve ink.

But if not, your browser can also remove background colors.

* For Google Chrome: when printing, [click on "More Options", then uncheck "Background graphics"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5c9XJbBGhSeRlmGxqZBRv5n4CTWZyag/view?usp=sharing)

* For Firefox: when viewing the print preview, [click "Page Setup" then uncheck "Print Background (colors & images)".](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VoVCC6ehqd8vZyO89PQq5hZbQ4u94vBK)

* For Firefox Extension "Print to PDF": [click on "Add-ons", then click "Print to PDF", then "Options", and uncheck "Whether the background colors should be shown"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WjCS84LLOL6v0ccjASjJ3c_vaUmgIfTO)

= How do I force a page break before something? (So it's always at the top of a page) =
[Add the CSS class](https://technicalsupport.blog/2019/01/04/how-to-add-a-custom-css-class-to-gutenberg-blocks/) "pmb-page-break" onto the the element/block you want to be at the top of the page.
== Screenshots ==

1. Print My Blog removes junk that doesn’t belong in a printout— like ink-guzzling logos, menus, search-bars, sidebars, footer widgets, etc.
2. Print Setup page, show basic options. You can setup your entire blog for printing within a few seconds.
3. Or you can use the more advanced Post Selection options to only include specific posts...
4. ...and customize what content gets included and how its formatted.
5. Optionally add print buttons to your posts for use by site visitors.
6. Setting up the print buttons is really simple.
7. Add the Print My Blog block to add a form visitors can use to select what and how to print your blog.
